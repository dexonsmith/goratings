        # depending on the number of games in the period. If there are fewer games in a period the RD is higher which
        # results in bigger changes per game.
        # We calculate imemdiate ratings each time a game ends. So after a new rating period started the game pool is
        # empty and we get a RD which can be much higher than the RD at the end of the last period, making the first
        # rating update in a period way stronger than it should be. This will be corrected by later rating updates, but
        # as we show this rating in UI and use it for match making, we see the over adjusted rating.
        # Here we limit the change of the rating early in a period by the deviation of the base rating multiplied by the
        # number of games played in the current periode. (This would be the maximum rating change if the updated
        # deviation would be the base rating. With the player playing more games, this limit will affect the rating
        # update less.)
